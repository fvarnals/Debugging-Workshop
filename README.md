# Debugging in Ruby

Makers Academy Workshop

For the two exercises in this workshop, the goal was to effectively debug, finding errors and fixing them systematically, using the following proceedure:

- Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)

- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)

- Once you know the one thing that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

> You should not change the tests, only the code, in this exercise.
